    <h1>Hi there</h1>
    <p>
        Thanks for being interested in our project. This is a game somewhat inspired by the mobile game Ingress, but in
        real life. Here's how it works. There are multiple locations around Boulder High School for our Game. You can
        claim a location for your team by using your student ID to hack it.
    </p>

    <p>
        A location consists of a monitor with stats/info and a scanner for claiming the location. To claim a location,
        simply hold your student ID under the scanner for a few seconds. Make sure not to obscure any of the white area,
        and make sure that the white area's text is facing away from you. If you need more help the monitor has more detailed instructions.
        On your first scan, you will automatically be assigned a team. The teams are blue, red, green, yellow with purple
        being reserved for robotics club members.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you claim a point for your team, that point will start collecting points for your team every second. A point earns 1 point
        a second with that number being affected by the multiplier of that point. The multiplier is the amount of people that have claimed the
        point for your team. So if you claim the point for your team, then 2 other members of your team also claim it your team would earn 3 points
        per second. But if someone from another team claims the location, your team will no longer gain points until you reclaim that point.
    </p>

    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>
        Wow, you're actually reading this. So writing this wasn't completely pointless. Anyway, here's the deal.
        If you scan your ID, we send your student ID, your first name and your last name to our servers over an encrypted
        connection. We process this information, including comparisons to a database of current students, then store it with
        information about the scan like the location and time. We do not save any images of your student ID or the picture on it.
        We do not distribute, sell or make available outside our services any information or data we collect from you.
        Our services will publicly show your first and last name on our location monitors if you are ranked on a leaderboard or
        are currently earning points for your team. If you would like your personal data removed or want to have any questions,
        feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:1157LandsharkRobotics@gmail.com">1157LandsharkRobotics@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Open Source</h3>
    <p>
        This project will eventually be fully open-sourced. Currently though, it is still too much work-in-progress. We will
        eventually post the link to the project here. But if you are interested in contributing please contact us.
        The project is built using mariaDB and php for the backend including handling scans and scoring while the code for the
        scanner is written in python using pytesseract for ID recognition and requests for handling networking.
        The UI is written in HTML/JavaScript/CSS using materializecss. It gets data from an API written in php on our server
        and a local API for the location status written in python with Flask. Contact us for more info if you're interested.
    </p>

    <h3>But why though</h3>
    <p>
        This is an experiment and final project for Mr. Jiron's computer-science classes. The main purpose was just to make
        something interesting that people could actually interact with.
