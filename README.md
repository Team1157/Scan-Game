# Scan-Game
This is a proof-of-concept for a game similar to Niantic's Ingress.
The point of the game is for there to be `nodes` or `locations` that have a scanner
that scans Boulder High Student ID's. Scanning a Student ID would then claim that
point for the person's team and award that team points every second. Another student
of the same team scanning their ID would increase the amount of points earned while
a student of another team scanning their ID would claim the `node` for their team only
stopping other teams from scoring and awarding their team points.
